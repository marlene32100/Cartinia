# Cartinia Classic Cars

[Live preview here](http://159.223.19.154/)

This website is a re-design for a pre-existing website.
The owner is a car dealer company that restore big cars in Poland and sell them in Europe.
They specialize in Dodge Ram restoring, so I chose to show the Dodge Ram logo in the background image on the home page. In this way, the user understands immediately that the company is serious and professional.

For the re-design, I used a similar structure to the pre-existent page (on-sale cars). I decided then to add more content to increase trustability and change the colour palette.

This website is thought to reach customers all over Europe, so it is important to show a professional image.
The owner of the customer wanted a very American look, so I opted for a colour palette based on blue, white and red.
As for fonts, I used a combination of AirstreamNF, Quicksand and Raleway.

The project has been made with **Node.js**.

I used **Pug.js** as a compiler and I integrated **Prismic**, so my customer is able to update images and text by himself. This is because the list of cars ready to sell and sold cars changes constantly and needs frequent updates.

I used **SCSS** as a CSS preprocessor as there are re-usable components and I wanted the structure to be as clear as possible.

**GSAP** has been used for animations. Animations are non-invasive because I thought that too much animation could distract the final user from the purpose of the website, which is to show a solid and professional image, as a car should be. Animation adds only a smooth flow to the navigation, without disturbing.

The final project is deployed on **Digital Ocean**, and I used **Filezilla** to upload files.
